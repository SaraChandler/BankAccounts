# Another hint :)
require 'CSV'

module Bank
  class Account
    # read up on attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor
    # read up on class variables (@variable)
    # The general pattern: 
      # def initianlize(stuff_comes_in)
          # @stuff = stuff_comes_in
      # end
      # now if you want to access stuff, you can just use @stuff rather than passing a local variable around
